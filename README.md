**Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a systems engineer with an affection for open source, the rust language, compilers, developer tooling, and a variety of other things.**

### My Career
After getting involved in open source in college via [RCOS](https://new.rcos.io/), and a brief internship, I started my career at the [MITRE Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitre_Corporation), an American not-for-profit organization. 
While I was there, I worked on some very cool tools to assess software supply chain security risks. One of them was even open-sourced: [hipcheck](https://github.com/mitre/hipcheck).
After my time at MITRE I started working at [Cloudflare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudflare), where I joined a small team of folks dedicated to protecting the internet from [Denial of Service attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack).
So far, none of my work there has been open-sourced, but I'll update here if that changes!

### My Open Source Work
Over the past few years, I've [added docs and examples to the rust standard library](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commits?author=vcfxb&since=2020-02-01&until=2025-02-06),
[implemented some of the tracing and error logic in rust's libgit2 wrapper](https://github.com/rust-lang/git2-rs/commits?author=vcfxb&since=2015-02-01&until=2025-02-06),
[added better error messages regarding macOS SecureTransport errors to libgit2 itself](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/commits?author=vcfxb&since=2015-02-01&until=2025-02-06),
[added a parser combinator to nom](https://github.com/rust-bakery/nom/commits?author=vcfxb&since=2015-02-01&until=2025-02-06),
and made a few other open source contributions in various repositories.

My main focus, on-and-off [since 2017, when it was a different repo and a different project](https://github.com/vcfxb/BlackRose/commit/bc59389093ba7bf00968fa0d917ae0bb49aa024d) (please don't read that code too deeply, I was a teenager when I wrote it lol)
has been [wright-lang](https://github.com/vcfxb/wright-lang), a programming language and compiler that I'm designing and building from scratch. I've stopped and restarted the project several times over the years, mostly 
relating to when I'm burnt out with it or when I have other things in my life keeping me busy, so it has evolved a lot since it's creation. Hopefully one day when it's more complete, I can give it it's own section here.

### Hobbies and Interests
In my free time have a variety of hobbies including hiking, making music, and playing [League of Legends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends). I'm also an avid car enthusiast, fashonista, foodie, and lover of frogs & other 
amphibians.

### Reaching Me

Otherwise feel free to message me on socical media ([Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/venusblon.de), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/venus_xeon/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/venus-xeon-blonde-72b198173/))

If you've gotten down here you've finished reading my little internet blurb about myself -- thanks! I'm not frequently one to be inspiring or deeply thoughtful online, but the internet is a crazy wonderful wild thing. I
feel incredibly lucky and grateful to live in a time where I have access to it, let alone am able to put my work onto it for the world to use and enjoy. Very few things in human history last forever, and I'm sure one
day the sun will set on the world wide web too. Until then though, I'm glad to have been online with you.

Humbly,
_Venus C. F. Xeon-Blonde_
